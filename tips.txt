TMUX POPUPS
⇧⇧ g = lazygit
⇧⇧ K = yazi
⇧⇧ S = scratch
lazygit popup: ⇧⇧ g
yazi popup: ⇧⇧ K
scratch popup: ⇧⇧ S
git? ⇧⇧ g
files? ⇧⇧ K
quick terminal? ⇧⇧ S
⇧⇧ g floats
⇧⇧ K floats
⇧⇧ S toggles
q closes lazygit
q closes yazi
⇧⇧ S again closes scratch
popups don't mess with panes
use ⇧⇧ g for git
use ⇧⇧ K for browsing
use ⇧⇧ S for quick stuff
stop opening panes for git
⇧⇧ g exists. use it.
⇧⇧ K exists. use it.
lazygit = ⇧⇧ g
yazi = ⇧⇧ K
scratch = ⇧⇧ S

THE FLOW: ⇧⇧K → - → ⇧⇧g
⇧⇧ K = yazi popup
- = oil
⇧⇧ g = lazygit popup
yazi → nvim → oil → lazygit
K finds, - manages, g commits
⇧⇧ K: browse files
- : parent dir in oil
⇧⇧ g: git popup
oil: edit line = rename
oil: delete line = delete file
oil: :w saves changes
oil: g. = hidden files
oil: C-p = preview
oil: gx = open external
lazygit: space = stage
lazygit: c = commit
lazygit: P = push
lazygit: ? = help
lazygit: tab = switch panel
lazygit: q = close
yazi: enter = open in nvim
yazi: space = select
yazi: . = hidden files
yazi: z = jump frequent
K, -, g. that's it.
find → edit → manage → commit
⇧⇧K → ⇧⇧g outer loop
- is inner loop
popups don't break panes
- in nvim = oil always
rename? - then edit
delete? - then dd
sibling files? just -
done? ⇧⇧ g
stage, commit, push, q
back to work
